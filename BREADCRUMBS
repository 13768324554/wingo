Work on layouts. Make them viable. Prompt for them. Allow layout to save and 
restore state (yuck).

EWMH for root window crap.

Check for other ICCCM conventions.

Tons and tons of documentation.

More Gribble commands. (Looping and conditionals? Query information?)

Add more options for configuration. Focus follows mouse?

Add support for _NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY (particularly to indicate focus).
