Fix weird gkrellm bug. (Close gkrellm. Struts don't refresh for maximized
windows. Ug.)

Make sure a client, when mapped, appears on screen (even if it means moving it 
to a workspace's root coordinates).

Add and remove workspaces. Fun...

Test various combinations of replacing Wingo with Openbox (and vice versa). 
Particularly in a multi-head setup.

Show a popup message when changing workspaces.

Work on layouts. Make them viable. Prompt for them. Allow layout to save and 
restore state (yuck).

EWMH for root window crap.

Check for other ICCCM conventions.

Tons and tons of documentation.

More Gribble commands. (Looping and conditionals? Query information?)

IPC Gribble interface.

Add more options for configuration. Focus follows mouse?

Add support for _NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY (particularly to indicate focus).
