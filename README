Things are currently *very* broken. Any attempt at getting Wingo running at the
moment will be completely fruitless. It's basically undergoing a *near*
re-write in light of the changes made to xgb and xgbutil.

A fully-featured and EWMH compliant window manager written in Go.

Please do not use Wingo yet. It's not ready.

If you need X stuff, please check out xgbutil. It probably isn't ready yet
either, but is infinitely more so than Wingo.
