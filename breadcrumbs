There's a pretty nasty problem when moving windows between monitors when
the monitors haven't different kinds of layouts active. Namely, if one monitor 
is floating while the other is tiling, there are a few problems:

1. When dragging a window from a tiling layout to a floating layout on another 
monitor, the window is removed from the tiling layout---and in the process, its 
geometry is "refreshed." This is desirable in that it will restore maximization 
state if necessary, and most importantly, revert back to the decorations used 
before tiling start. The only undesirable side effect is reverting the geometry 
of the client. It's quite awkward *only* when manually moving the window, so I 
think loadGeom will have to look and see if the client is in the middle of 
moving or resizing.

2. When using HeadFocusWithClient from a tiler to floating, the wrong state is 
saved and reloaded. A possible solution to this is to allow geometry state 
"copying." i.e., copy the "layout_before_tiling" to "monitor_switch", and load 
that geometry after all is said and done.
